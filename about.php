    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>CatCatGo was created by Jorge Otero and Ricardo Gonzalez with help of Mimi the cat. The first version of CatCatGo was created 23 of june of 2020.</p>
    <br>
    <p>It was another logo and a diferent search engine. We was happy, but as we we're using Google's search engine creator, <a href="https://twitter.com/sammwy">Sammwy</a> told us that Google can report us.</p>
    <p>Months later, we got a new search engine without copyright (developed by <a href="https://twitter.com/sammwy">Sammwy</a>).</p>
    <p>The 27 of february of 2021, we created the third (actual) version of CatCatGo.</p>
    <p>This version have photos of a real cat (the cat is of Ricardo) and more features like DuckDuckGo API (for search results).</p>
    <p>We developed this all by 0, with help of our developers.</p>
    <h6>*Google AND DuckDuckGo are not related with CatCatGo</h6>
